I chose this article because I agree with its message and think that the existence of free and open source software has been one of the most important forces driving technological progress and economic growth. I don't think that people realize how much of the tech that they use and rely on a daily basis is built on top of open source solutions and I hope developers always continue to put out software accessible to everyone.
